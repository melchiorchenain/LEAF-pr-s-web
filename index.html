                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>LEAF social media takes pride in being accessible to everyone and allowing users to play a key part in the social media platform. We aim for all users to use the network to support their causes freely. LEAF gives access to all features and does not privilege popular users. The LEAF domain is accessible from anywhere in the world. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Respect</h3>
                <p>LEAF ensures that people using the website are protected from any form of violence or hate speech, as its algorithm will analyze each user's posts and messages. If the algorithm considers the post inappropriate, it will automatically refuse to post it and warn the user of their misconduct. After three warnings, LEAF will automatically ban the user. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>LEAF places much importance on guaranteeing users' safety on its media, and all personal information provided is encrypted. It asks permission from users to share their geolocation and status while using the app. The site will also be protected from cyber attacks, so no one should ever encounter an issue while using LEAF. </p>

            <h3>The Code</h3> 
            <p> I developed LEAF using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, and SQL. I decided to use PHP for its fast, simple, and direct access to the MySQL database. It also links to HTML, which is very convenient when testing LEAF. I used JavaScript to create real-time responses and adapt to all web browsers, websites, and applications, which are crucial to LEAF's functions. I also chose to use the MySQL database as it is flexible, powerful, and quick while remaining accessible and affordable. Finally, CSS is linked to HTML and makes the front end of any website shine. </p>
